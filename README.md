This quantum AI project leverages quantum-inspired optimization to accelerate training and enhance real-time predictions of hurricane trajectories and intensities. The model, applied to Hurricane Debby (2024), demonstrated superior accuracy compared to traditional models, particularly in predicting the storm's path and intensity.
